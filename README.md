# Toxicity Detector

## 🛠️ Setup

### TODO

* [ ] Describe the environment and dependencies (e.g., Python version, required libraries like `torch`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`).
* [ ] Provide instructions for cloning the repository and installing dependencies (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
* [ ] Explain how to download or access the necessary training and evaluation data.
* [ ] Detail the command to run the main script (e.g., `python train.py`).

## 📈 Results
